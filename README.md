This project focused on creating a robust database to streamline student and school administration, providing a unified system for managing academic records, extracurricular activities, and post-secondary planning. By designing the database in the third normal form (3NF), the structure ensures data integrity, minimizes redundancy, and optimizes performance. The system enables easy data retrieval and comprehensive reporting, allowing teachers, administrative staff, and the principal to track student progress efficiently. The database enhances the overall functionality of the schoolâ€™s information management system for better decision-making and support.
